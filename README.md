<p>As a psychology student, digital artist, and blog writer with a keen interest in learning new tech languages, I've recently embarked on my first project by creating a website using only HTML and CSS. This endeavor allowed me to integrate my 2D art pieces into various pages, aiming to blend my diverse interests into a cohesive platform. The primary objective of this website is to provide support to individuals dealing with stress and anxiety, leveraging insights from psychology alongside creative expression and technological exploration.</p>
