If not, my friends have woven some beautiful words into a poem for you, which I'm happy to share (with full credit given, of course, and their permission to use it). Below the poems, you will find four downloadable art pieces that can serve as a potential substitute for color therapy. </b></font></p>

    I know you have a goal,
    I know you have a passion,
    I know you have a spirit and thoughts burning like fires!
    Now consumed by the voids of the world,
    Leaving none that is yours,
    You're fighting demons tonight,
    Just like last night,
    Only with a little more need of hope
    To reach the other side again.
    Where did it all start? When does it all end?
    From the thoughts that keep you at gunpoint ,
    You yell "leave me!" but they just won't?
    How do you tell yourself, you're bolder than these horrors?
    One might never know
    What strength it takes to go
    As each day folds and
    All you can do, is move as the time flows,
    Where pain holds close but
    Closer held, is the once naive child's voice that
    Shushed the monsters under the bed,
    The voice that is, the hope well fed.
    For there's nothing better than tomorrow,
    Nothing better than a good tomorrow!
    And should you need, may you borrow,
    A string of hope from the hearts of sorrows,
    That once you pushed through.
    Why you're to know from where you have soared oh!
    You're stronger than all of these horrors.!

    Hey there, friend.
    How's life treating you?
    If it's tough, take some time,
    To give yourself the care you're due.
                    
    Life’s too short to wake with regrets,
    Love those who treat you right,
    Forget the ones who don’t,
    And trust things happen for a reason, day or night.
                            
    If a chance comes, grab it tight,
    If it changes you, let it be.
    No one said it’d be easy,
    ut they promised it’d be worth the fight.
                            
    I'm proud of you,
    Take care, and hold on tight.
